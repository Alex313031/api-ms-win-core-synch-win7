Tested: Windows 7 x64, SBCL 2.2.0 x86 and x64. This DLL should also work on
Windows Vista although that has not been extensively tested. If there is a
bug, please open an issue or contact vxiiduu#4598 on discord.

If you find another program that requires this DLL and needs more redirected
functions or more new functions, also feel free to contact/open an issue to
get the new functions/redirections added to this project.

The code was compiled on Visual Studio 2010. In order to compile it yourself,
create a new blank DLL project, and add the .c source code file. Change the
project configuration according to your needs and compile. Default settings
should work fine.
